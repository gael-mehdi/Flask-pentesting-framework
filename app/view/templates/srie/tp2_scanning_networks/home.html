        <!-- Description -->
        <p class="lead">
            Network scanning is a critical step in the information gathering process, playing a vital role in successful exploitation 
            or infiltration of a remote system. As the second step in the penetration testing process, network scanning involves using specialized 
            tools to actively discover and gather valuable information from the target network.


        </p>
                
        <p class="lead">
           In this lab, you will learn the significance of network scanning and its importance in obtaining crucial insights that can be leveraged to assess the 
           security posture of the target system. By systematically scanning the network, we can identify active hosts, open ports, and services running on those hosts. 
           This valuable intelligence allows us to assess potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and attack vectors within the network infrastructure.

	   
        
        <p class="lead">
           Network scanning provides us with a comprehensive overview of the target's network environment, enabling us to create a detailed map of the network topology. 
	   By understanding the network's structure, we can identify critical assets, potential entry points, and areas that require further investigation.

    <div class="container p-5 my-5 border">
        <p class="lead">
            Below is a list of tools that can be used for this pentesting phase:
        </p>
        
        <ol class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5><a href="{{url_for('blueprint.srie_tp2_pingaddr')}}" class="list-group-item-action">Ping an IP address</a></h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    Ping can be used during a penetration test to send ICMP Echo Request packets to a target system or 
                    network, and then analyze the response to gather information about the target. By sending ping requests and 
                    analyzing the responses, pentesters can determine if a host is online, assess its response time (round-trip time or 
                    RTT), and identify potential targets for further exploration or exploitation.
                </p>
            </li>
             <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5><a href="{{url_for('blueprint.srie_tp2_nmap')}}" class="list-group-item-action">Nmap</a></h5>
                <p class="lead">
                   Nmap (Network Mapper) is a versatile network scanning tool that serves the purpose of discovering and mapping hosts, services, and vulnerabilities 
                   on a computer network. It allows to gain insight into the network's structure, identify available hosts, determine the services running on those hosts, 
                   and assess potential security risks. By providing detailed information about the network, Nmap enables effective network management, vulnerability assessment, 
                   and security auditing, ultimately helping to ensure the network's integrity and protect against potential threats.

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5><a href="{{url_for('blueprint.srie_tp2_fping')}}"  class="list-group-item-action">FPing</a></h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    The FPing function is a network diagnostic tool that operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request packets to a target host or a range of IP addresses. Unlike the traditional ping utility, which sends one ICMP Echo Request packet at a time, FPing has the capability to send multiple packets in quick succession. This enables network administrators to perform efficient and rapid network monitoring and troubleshooting tasks. FPing can be used to determine the availability and responsiveness of hosts, measure round-trip times, identify packet loss, and assess network performance. It provides a comprehensive overview of the network's health by allowing administrators to simultaneously check the status of multiple hosts, helping them identify potential connectivity issues and promptly address them.                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5><a href="{{url_for('blueprint.srie_tp2_traceroute')}}" class="list-group-item-action">Traceroute</a></h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    The Traceroute function is a network diagnostic tool that works by mapping the path that network packets take from a source device to a destination device. When initiated, Traceroute sends a series of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets with gradually increasing time-to-live (TTL) values. Each packet is given a TTL value that starts at 1 and is incremented by one for each subsequent packet. When a packet reaches a network device along its route, such as a router, the TTL value is decremented. If the TTL reaches zero, the device discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source device. This process continues until the packet reaches the destination device, which then sends an ICMP Echo Reply message back to the source. By examining the series of ICMP Time Exceeded messages received, the Traceroute function can determine the sequence of network devices or routers that the packet encountered during its journey. This information helps in identifying the network path, measuring latency, and pinpointing potential bottlenecks or connectivity issues, making Traceroute a valuable tool for network troubleshooting and optimization.                </p>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5><a href="{{url_for('blueprint.srie_tp2_ifconfig')}}" class="list-group-item-action">IfConfig</a></h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    The IfConfig function, short for "Interface Configuration," is a command-line utility used to view and configure network interfaces on a computer system. When executed, IfConfig retrieves detailed information about the network interfaces present on the system, such as their IP addresses, netmasks, MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, and other relevant parameters. It allows users to configure and manage network settings, including assigning IP addresses, enabling or disabling interfaces, modifying network parameters, and adjusting network routing. Additionally, IfConfig provides real-time feedback on the status and statistics of network interfaces, including data transfer rates, packet counts, and error information. With its comprehensive set of functionalities, IfConfig is an essential tool for network administrators and users to inspect and control network interfaces, facilitating efficient network management and troubleshooting.                </p>
