        <!-- Description -->
        <p class="lead">
            In this lab you will perform enumeration of the target. The metrics, outcomes and results in
this phase are used directly in testing the system in the next step of pen testing. Enumeration
helps to decipher the detailed information like Hostnames, IP tables, SNMP and DNS,
Application, Banners, Audit configurations and service settings. The significance of
Enumeration is that it systematically collects details.
One type of enumeration that we are going to do in this lab is banner grabbing. It is a
technique used to gather information about running services and operating system(s) on a
device. Banners refer to the messages on the host that usually provide a greeting or version
information. An attacker can use banner data to their advantage by obtaining specific version
numbers of services to aid in reconnaissance and exploitation.

            Below is a list of tools that can be used for this pentesting phase:

        <ol class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5><a href="{{url_for('blueprint.srie_tp3_nmap')}}" class="list-group-item-action">Nmap</a></h5>
                <p class="lead">
                   Banner grabbing mainly consists of sending requests to services in order to get
responses which will allow us to learn their versions, it may be considered part of the OS and
version detection process to know our target’s software and its possible vulnerabilities for
future exploitation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5><a href="{{url_for('blueprint.srie_tp3_telnet')}}" class="list-group-item-action">Telnet</a></h5>
                <p class="lead">
                   The telnet command is a networking protocol used for establishing an interactive
communication session with another host via the TELNET protocol. This protocol enables a
user to access and communicate with a remote computer as if they were physically present
at the remote location.
